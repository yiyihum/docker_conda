+intervaltree: A mutable, self-balancing interval tree for Python 2 and 3.
+Queries may be by point, by range overlap, or by range envelopment.
+
+Test module: IntervalTree, remove_overlap caused incorrect balancing
+where intervals overlapping an ancestor's x_center were buried too deep.
+Submitted as issue #72 (KeyError raised after calling remove_overlap)
