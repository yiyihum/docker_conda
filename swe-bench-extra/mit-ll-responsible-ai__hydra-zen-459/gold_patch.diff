+Bug Fixes
+---------
+- Configs produced by `~hydra_zen.just` will no longer cause a `ReadonlyConfigError` during Hydra's config-composition process. See :pull:`459`
 
 Compatibility-Breaking Changes
 ------------------------------
 - The auto-instantiation behavior of :class:`~hydra_zen.wrapper.Zen` and :func:`~hydra_zen.zen` have been updated so that nested dataclasses (nested within lists, dicts, and other dataclasses) will no longer be returned as omegaconf configs (see :pull:`448`).
 - hydra-core 1.2.0 and omegaconf 2.2.1 are now the minimum supported versions.
+- :func:`~hydra_zen.just` not longer returns a frozen dataclass (see :pull:`459`).
