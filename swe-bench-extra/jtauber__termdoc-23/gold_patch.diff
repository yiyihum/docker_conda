 ## HTDM
 
-The core data structure is a term-document matrix supporting hierarchical documents. Documents are labelled with a tuple such as `(1, 7, 5)` or `("Plato", "Republic", "Book 5")` (the type of each item in the tuple does not matter). This hierarchy could represent divisions of a work, grouping of multiple works, or some combination. Counts are aggregated at each level of the hierarchy (including at the top level to get totals across all documents).
