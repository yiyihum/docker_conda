 # Changelog for mokapot
 
 ## [Unreleased]
+
+## [v0.10.1] - 2023-09-11
 ### Breaking changes
 - Mokapot now uses `numpy.random.Generator` instead of the deprecated `numpy.random.RandomState` API.
-  New `rng` arguments have been added to functions and classes that rely on randomness in lieu of setting a global random seed with `np.random.seed()`. Thanks @sjust-seerbio!

 ### Fixed
 - The PepXML reader, which broke due to a Pandas update.
 - Potential bug if lowercase peptide sequences were used and protein-level confidence estimates were enabled
+- Multiprocessing led to the same training set being used for all splits (#104).
