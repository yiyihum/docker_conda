+* This release is the last to support Python 2.7.
 * Fixed issue when `response.iter_content` when `chunk_size=None` entered infinite loop
 * Fixed issue when `passthru_prefixes` persisted across tests.
   Now `add_passthru` is valid only within a context manager or for a single function and
   cleared on exit
-* Deprecate ``match_querystring`` argument in ``Response`` and ``CallbackResponse``.
+* Deprecate `match_querystring` argument in `Response`` and `CallbackResponse`.
   Use `responses.matchers.query_param_matcher` or `responses.matchers.query_string_matcher`
 * Added support for non-UTF-8 bytes in `responses.matchers.multipart_matcher`
 * Added `responses.registries`. Now user can create custom registries to
   manipulate the order of responses in the match algorithm
   `responses.activate(registry=CustomRegistry)`
+* Fixed issue with response match when requests were performed between adding responses with
+  same URL. See Issue #212
