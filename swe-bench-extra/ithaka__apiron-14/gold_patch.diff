+## [Unreleased]
+### Added
+- The `check_for_trailing_slash` behavior can now be used on `JsonEndpoint`s
+
+### Changed
+- Service domains and endpoint paths were previously joined per [IETF RCF 1808](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1808.html),
+  which has surprising edge cases.
+  These are now always joined by appending the endpoint path;
+  the previous behavior can be achieved with multiple services or endpoints as needed.
+
 ## [1.1.0] - 2018-12-03
 ### Added
 - Exposed ability to explicitly set the response encoding
