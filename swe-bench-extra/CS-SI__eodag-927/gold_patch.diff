 CLMS_GLO_LAI_333M,"LAI was defined by CEOS as half the developed area of the convex hull wrapping the green canopy elements per unit horizontal ground. This definition allows accounting for elements which are not flat such as needles or stems. LAI is strongly non linearly related to reflectance. Therefore, its estimation from remote sensing observations will be scale dependant over heterogeneous landscapes. When observing a canopy made of different layers of vegetation, it is therefore mandatory to consider all the green layers. This is particularly important for forest canopies where the understory may represent a very significant contribution to the total canopy LAI. The derived LAI corresponds therefore to the total green LAI, including the contribution of the green elements of the understory.

The calculated LTS include the minimum, median, maximum, average, standard deviation and the number of observations in the covered time series period. These LTS can be used as a reference for actual NDVI observations, which allows evaluating whether vegetation conditions deviate from a 'normal' situation.

 EEA_DAILY_SSM_1KM,"Surface Soil Moisture (SSM) is the relative water content of the top few centimetres soil, describing how wet or dry the soil is in its topmost layer, expressed in percent saturation. It is measured by satellite radar sensors and allows insights in local precipitation impacts and soil conditions. SSM is a key driver of water and heat fluxes between the ground and the atmosphere, regulating air temperature and humidity. Moreover, in its role as water supply, it is vital to vegetation health. Vice versa, SSM is very sensitive to external forcing in the form of precipitation, temperature, solar irradiation, humidity, and wind. SSM is thus both an integrator of climatic conditions and a driver of local weather and climate, and plays a major role in global water-, energy- and carbon- cycles. Knowledge on the dynamics of soil moisture is important in the understanding of processes in many environmental and socio-economic fields, e.g., its impact on vegetation vitality, crop yield, droughts or exposure to flood threats.

 EEA_DAILY_SWI_1KM,"The Soil Water Index (SWI) quantifies the moisture condition at various depths in the soil. It is mainly driven by the precipitation via the process of infiltration. Soil moisture is a very heterogeneous variable and varies on small scales with soil properties and drainage patterns. Satellite measurements integrate over relative large-scale areas, with the presence of vegetation adding complexity to the interpretation. Soil moisture is a key parameter in numerous environmental studies including hydrology, meteorology and agriculture, and is recognized as an Essential Climate Variable (ECV) by the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS). The SWI product provides daily information about moisture conditions in different soil layers. It includes a quality flag (QFLAG) indicating the availability of SSM measurements for SWI calculations, and a Surface State Flag (SSF) indicating frozen or snow covered soils.
