@@ -49,6 +49,63 @@ The form of the 2-D correction (point or uniform) that's appropriate for the
 data is divided into the SCI and ERR arrays and propagated into the variance
 arrays of the science data.
 
+The MSA reference file contains 2 entries: one for a 1x1 slit and one for a 1x3 slit.
+Each entry contains the pathloss correction for point source and uniform sources.
+The former depends on the position of the target in the fiducial shutter and
+wavelength, whereas the latter depends on wavelength only.  The point source 
+entry consists of a 3-d array, where 2 of the dimensions map to the location
+of the source (ranging from -0.5 to 0.5 in both X and Y), while the third dimension
+carries the wavelength dependence.  The 1x3 shutter is 3 times as large in Y as in X.
+
+The entry to use for a point source target is determined by looking at the shutter_state
+attribute of the slit used.  This is a string with a length equal to the number
+of shutters that make up the slit, with 1 denoting an open shutter, 0 a closed
+shutter and x the fiducial (target) shutter.  The reference entry is determined
+by how many shutters next to the fiducial shutter are open:
+
+If both adjacent shutters are closed, the 1x1 entry is used.  A matching
+shutter_state might be 'x' or '10x01'
+
+If both adjacent shutters are open, the center region of the 1x3 entry is used.
+This would be the case for a slit with shutter state '1x1' or '1011x1'.
+
+If one adjacent shutter is open and one closed, the 1x3 entry is used.  If the
+shutter below the fiducial is open and the shutter above closed, then the upper
+region of the 1x3 pathloss array is used.  This is implemented by adding 1 to the
+Y coordinate of the target position (bringing it into the range +0.5 to +1.5),
+moving it to the upper third of the pathloss array.  A matching shutter state
+might be '1x' or '11x011'
+
+Similarly, if the shutter below the fiducial is closed and that above is open, the
+lower third of the pathloss array is used by subtracting 1 from the Y coordinate of
+the target position (bringing it into the range -1.5 to -0.5).  A matching shutter
+state could be 'x111' or '110x1'.
+
+Once the X and Y coordinates of the source are mapped into a pixel location in the
+spatial dimensions of the pathloss array using the WCS of the transformation of position
+to pixel location, the wavelength dependence is determined
+by interpolating at that (fractional) pixel position in each wavelength plane,
+resulting in a pair of 1-d arrays of pathloss correction and wavelength.  These arrays
+are used to interpolate the correction for each pixel of the 2-d extracted science
+array, since each pixel has a different wavelength, and the correction is applied
+to the science pixel array.
+
+For uniform sources, there is no dependence of the pathloss correction on position,
+so the correction arrays are just 1-d arrays of correction and wavelength.  Once
+again, the shutter_state attribute of each slit is used to determine the correction
+entry used:
+
+If both shutters adjacent to the fiducial are closed, the 1x1 entry is used
+
+If both shutters adjacent to the fiducial are open, the 1x3 entry is used
+
+If one is closed and one is open, the correction used is the average of the 1x1
+and 1x3 entries.
+
+Like for the point source case, the 1-d arrays of pathloss correction and wavelength
+are used to interpolate the correction for each pixel in the science data, using the
+wavelength of each pixel to interpolate into the pathloss correction array.
